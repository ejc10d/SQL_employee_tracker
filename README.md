# Challenge_12

## Description
This application is a command line interface (CLI) that combines inquirer, SQL, and node all into one project. Upon running the user will be presented with a menu where they can make a selection. Each selection that is made with either show the requested data or prompt the user for more input. The idea of this project is that it is set up to be an employee database. I used the characters from the show The Office as my seed data. 

## Instructions
To run this application you  must have all the code. Then open the command line and run mysql. After that you need to source the schema and the seeds. Then you can cd back to your main folder to run node on server.js. This will begin the program right in your command line.
